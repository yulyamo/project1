  <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
  <p>To live fully and happy, it is important to work on spirit and mind. I believe in 
	 law of attraction and consistently work on my spiritual growth. I have attended many 
	 seminars and workshops, and I am an active volunteer at events of Tony Robbins who is a famous
	 motivational speaker and coach.</p>
  <p>Here is the picture from the last live event called Date With Destiny. It was held
     in West Palm Beach, FL in December 2019. All people in the picture including myself are volunteers.</p>

  <h2>Travel</h2>
  <p>I love to visit new places. Also, I have learned that traveling expands our mind and 
	 forces for critical thinking because of new unfamiliar environment. One of my favorite 
	 places is Crested Butte, Colorado. This small town is known for summer mount biking and scenic
	 meadows full of unique wildflowers. Crested Butte has the title of "Wildflower Capital of Colorado".</p>
