<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my page!</p>
<p>My name is Yulia Moiseyenko, and this is my first year at IIT. I have transferred from
the College of DuPage, where I studied business, and is considered to be a third-year student.
I picked ITM as my major. Also, I am planning to minor in Business.
I am new to the information technology field, but I liked it after the first semester. 
I strongly believe that progress equals happiness; so, I love to learn new things. 
Besides school, I am a day trader focusing on options and futures.</p>
<p>Originally, I am from Belarus and moved to the United States nine years ago.
I speak three languages: English, Russian, and Belarusian.</p>
